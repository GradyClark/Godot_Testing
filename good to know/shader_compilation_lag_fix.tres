Godot/OpenGl for some reason compiles shaders the first time the enter the viewport,
not before. This causes a good deal of lag at times.
To fix this have all the scenes materials/textures visible by the viewport at scene load
then hide them, but don't delete them. (I think, but hiding them might not work idk)

tldr: Shaders are compiled lazily, 
  this causes lag the first time an texture/material appears on screen.
  Fix: Load all shaders at scene load
